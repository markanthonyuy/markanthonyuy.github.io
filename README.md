Dear Future self,

You messed up your repository! Idiot!

Your branch [v2](https://github.com/markanthonyuy/markanthonyuy.github.io/tree/v2) is now your nextjs dev while the branch [master](https://github.com/markanthonyuy/markanthonyuy.github.io/tree/master) is the output file of nextjs SSG. Please remember that.

P.S. Please fix this in the future so we both can live in peace.

Yours truly,
Mark in the present
