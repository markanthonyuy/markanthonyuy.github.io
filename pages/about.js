          I'm Mark a.k.a. "Mac", husband to Bev, son of Tony and Lerma and the
          youngest of their children. My wife and I love to travel. We've seen
          the best white sand beaches of the Philippines, to the beautiful
          islands of Maldives, From the futuristic cities of Japan, to the{' '}
          <s> towering Sky Scrappers of New York</s> (trip canceled due to
          COVID-19). We love to explore, chill with nature, marvel at cities
          architecture, learn other cultures and taste the exotic flavor of
          their cuisine, meet different kinds of people and make new friends.

          I also like Ancient History, Astronomy and Physics. From the mystery
          of building the Great Pyramid Giza to the countless posibility of
          another civilization million miles away, to the question of the
          discovery of parallel universe. (I just hope I'm tall, rich and good
          looking man somewhere there. üòÇ) Those are the questions that makes me
          wonder at night.

          I've been web developing for 8+ years now. Time does indeed fly when
          you're having fun. It seems only yesterday when I started converting
          PSD's to HTML as my first web developer job. Then I became a Software
          Engineer in the BPO industry. I got to work with various companies
          there. I work mostly on front-end development because that's where I
          found my passion. I love seeing fast, creative and intuitive websites.
          Google lighthouse is my friend.

            ‚ÄúCreating a website is a process of setting the right colors to
            define mood and apply the right contrast to emphasize an element,
            implementing the right font sizes to define hierarchy, adding
            animations to symbolize interaction and activity, intuitive enough
            so that visitors understands the flow of the website and faster than
            the speed of light.‚Äú ‚Äï Mark Anthony Uy

          I'm very passionate at what I do even though it's not easy keeping up
          with the technologies. It feels impossible to learn everything but if
          there's one thing I learn from using Linux, it's{' '}
          <b>Do one thing and do it really good</b>. That's the reason I focus
          in the front-end side.

          In the near future, I plan to learn Gatsby, GraphQL, Typscript,
          Strapijs, Redwoodjs, Sveltejs and Figma. This goes with the quote that
          I really love.

          The new redesign of my website is inspired by my favorite websites. I
          often got my ideas from looking at other people work, then I add my
          own flavor and style to the mix. For example the colored border that
          wrapped the quotes is inspired by Codepen's button, Bigger fonts is
          from Smashing magazine and Design course website. Hopefully, I was
          able to create something cool. If you want a peek of my old design
          here is the <a href="https://markanthonyuy.com/old">link</a> .
